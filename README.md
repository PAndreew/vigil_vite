**Vigil** is an open-source browser extension that acts as a firewall between your sensitive data and AI chatbots currently in Public Alpha. It intercepts pastes and (some) file uploads, scans them for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and other forms of sensitive data, and allows you to redact sensitive data *before* it leaves your browser.

---

## Features

*   **Real-time Interception:** Automatically detects when you paste text or upload files to supported sites (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
*   **Smart Redaction:** Identifies Emails, Credit Cards, SSNs, API Keys, and custom Regex patterns.
*   **File Scanning:** "Peeks" into uploaded text/code files (CSV, JSON, PY, TS, TXT) to detect secrets before upload.
*   **Granular Control:** 
    *   **Redact:** Replace sensitive data with placeholders (e.g., `[REDACTED EMAIL]`).
    *   **Original:** Bypass the filter for non-sensitive contexts.
    *   **Cancel:** Block the action entirely.
*   **Privacy First:** All scanning happens locally in the browser. Your data is never sent to a cloud server for analysis.

## Installation (Developer Mode)

Vigil is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
