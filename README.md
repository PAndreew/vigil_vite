**Vigil DLP** is an open-source browser extension that acts as a firewall between your sensitive data and AI chatbots currently in Public Alpha. It intercepts pastes and (some) file uploads, scans them for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and other forms of sensitive data (like API keys), and allows you to redact sensitive data *before* it leaves your browser.

---

## Features

*   **Real-time Interception:** Automatically detects when you paste text or upload files to supported sites (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
*   **Smart Redaction:** Identifies Emails, Credit Cards, SSNs, API Keys, and custom Regex patterns.
*   **File Scanning (Limited):** "Peeks" into uploaded text/code files (CSV, JSON, PY, TS, TXT) to detect secrets before upload.
*   **Granular Control:** 
    *   **Redact:** Replace sensitive data with placeholders that keep the structure of the original. For example +361513734 becomes +00000000.
    *   **Original:** Bypass the filter for non-sensitive contexts.
    *   **Cancel:** Block the action entirely.
*   **Privacy First:** All scanning happens locally in the browser. Your data is never sent to a cloud server for analysis.

## Installation (Developer Mode)

Vigil is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

1.  **Clone the repository**

    *   Click **Load unpacked**.
    *   Select the `dist` folder generated by the build step.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1.  **Protecting Sites:** Click the Vigil extension icon in your toolbar. Add domains you want to monitor (e.g., `chatgpt.com`, `claude.ai`, `github.com`).
2.  **Hotkeys:**
    *   `Alt + R`: Confirm Redaction (Paste Modified).
    *   `Alt + O`: Paste Original (Bypass).
    *   `Esc`: Cancel Paste/Upload.

## 🔮 Project Roadmap & Commercial Goals
Vigil is currently in Public Alpha. We are committed to keeping the core browser extension open-source and free for individuals.
Future Development Roadmap:

- [x] Local PII Detection (Email, Phone, CC)

- [x] (!Partially) File Upload Scanning

- [ ] Custom Regex Rule Builder (UI)

- [ ] Team Management (Centralized Policy Administration) *

- [ ] Compliance Reporting (Audit Logs & Analytics) *

* These features are planned for a future "Vigil for Business" self-hosted/managed offering to support the project's sustainability.
